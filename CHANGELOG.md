# Changelog

## 2026-10-20

### Running changes how you resupply; magazine guns drop their loaded mag on a reload (`074b276`)
- Sprinting cancels a reload in progress — nothing is lost, the magazine comes back as it was — and prevents a new reload from starting, including the automatic one on an empty mag.
- Running over an ammo box no longer collects it; stand or walk over one to pick it up.
- Box-magazine guns (Carbine, SMG, AK-47, Uzi, Pistol, Desert Eagle) now swap the magazine on a reload: unfired rounds left in the old one are dropped, and the new one holds only what the reserve has.
- Tube, break-action, bolt-action and cylinder guns (Shotgun, Double barrel, Sniper, Mosin, Revolver) are unaffected: they keep their loaded rounds and top up.

### build.sh fails with a hint when wasm-bindgen is missing (`715067c`)
- The build script now stops with an explicit error and the `cargo install wasm-bindgen-cli` command (matching the version in `Cargo.toml`) instead of a cryptic failure.

### Ammo boxes: finite per-weapon reserves topped up each wave (`f21bee7`)
- Ammo is finite: each weapon has a reserve capped at 2× its magazine, starting full each life; reloads draw from it, and an empty reserve leaves the gun silent.
- Ammo boxes spawn per wave (6 + 3 per wave number) at reachable ground away from the player; standing or walking over one adds a full magazine to every weapon's reserve (capped), without touching the loaded magazine.
- Boxes stay until collected or the wave resets, and clear when you die.
- The HUD ammo readout shows loaded / reserve; the loadout menu lists each gun's reserve cap and the per-box bonus; pickups play a sound.
- Fixed a render bug: the crate's yellow band was depth-occluded inside the crate body (invisible by construction); the band now overhangs the case so it reads at range.
